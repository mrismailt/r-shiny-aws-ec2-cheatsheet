# R Shiny running on AWS EC2 with https, SSL, and custom domain name, all without spending a dime!

I often have host webapplications I build for my clients on a server for easy access on their end. This in and of itself is a process. However, it doesn't look very nice sending them a long AWS Public DNS address or a bunch of numbers in the form of a Public IP address. So I've often had to acquire free domain names to make the deliverable more appealing. Sometimes, clients require webapps to be embeded into their websites. Since people rarely build websites from scratch anymore, most website builders do not allow iframe's referencing insecure addresses. This forces us to https secure the webapps we send our clients! This too can be done for free. Below is the cleaned up and nicely formatted version of a notepad document I had prepared for myself. I hope that by making this public I may ease the work of others as well!
